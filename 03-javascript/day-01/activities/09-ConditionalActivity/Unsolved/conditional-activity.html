// * Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.
let eatSteak = confirm('Do you eat steak?')
// * If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"

// * If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"

// * **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"
let birthYear = prompt ('What year were you born?')
if (birthYear < 1999) {
    alert('Have as much Sake as you like!');

// alerts appear before document.write

// * **HINT:** You will need to use `document.write()` from a few slides back.
