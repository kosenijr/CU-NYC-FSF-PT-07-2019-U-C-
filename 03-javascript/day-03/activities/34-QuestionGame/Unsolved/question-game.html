### Instructions

* Starting from a blank HTML file, create an array with 10 question objects. Each object in the array should be structured as follows: 
//   `{ q: "QUESTION", a: "ANSWER" }`.
* Then create code that will ask the user questions, one by one. The user must answer by hitting t (for true) or f (for false).
* Check the user's answer against the correct answer, and provide them with an alert telling them if they are right or wrong.
* **BONUS:** Keep track of the user's score.
* **HINT:** Don't worry about having DRY code to start with. Just focus on getting working code first.
